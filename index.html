    <h2>what is this?</h2>
    <p>
    I have a problem. The problem is that I can't find motivation to learn
    subjects that I find interesting, particularly math subjects.
    <br><br> 
    In highschool I began to love learning. I don't know if it was the pace, the
    material or the atmosphere, but it worked. Once I got to university I lost
    the passion. I can try to pin it on people, teachers, courses, but
    ultimately I think the blame rests on my own shoulders. So something has to
    change.
    <br><br> 
    I love to teach and so I'm going to try to use this project as a means to
    learn, teach, share and most importantly motivate.
