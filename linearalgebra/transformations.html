    <h2>intro</h2>
    <h2>definition</h2>
    <p>
    A <strong>linear transformation</strong> is a <em>mapping</em> between vector
    spaces.
    <blockquote>
      We represent <em>mapping</em> between two vector spaces with an arrow
      indicating which way we are mapping. So if we map <em>from</em> `RR` <em>to</em>
      `RR^2`, we indicate this by `RR rarr RR^2`. 
    </blockquote>
    Linear transformations must have the two following properties:
    <br><br>
    For a linear transformation `L: RR^n rarr RR^m`
    <ol>
      <a name="prop1">
      <li>
        For vectors `x,y in RR^n`
        <center>`L(x + y) = L(x) + L(y)` </center>
      </li>
      </a>
      <a name="prop2">
      <li>
        For a scalar `alpha in RR`
        <center>`L(alpha x) = alpha L(x)`</center>
      </li>
      </a>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>some examples</h2>
    <p>
    If you're like me, definitions are great but you need to become familiar with
    them in order to understand, so let's go through some examples of linear transformations.
    <br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>very simple</h3>
         A very simple linear transformation between `RR^2` and
        `RR^2` is <center>`L_1(x_1,x_2)=(x_1, x_2)`</center> All this transformation
        does is take a vector from `RR^2` and maps it back to the exact same vector!
        <br>
        
        I guess this example isn't much of a <em>transformation</em>, 
        but we should ensure it meets the two definition properties:
        <ol>
          <li>
            To ensure <a href="#prop1">property 1</a> holds for the map `L_1` we need two arbitrary vectors from `RR^2`. Let's call 
            them `x=(x_1, x_2)` and `y=(y_1, y_2)`.
            <br>
            $$\begin{align}
              L_1(x+y)&=L_1(x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2)\\
                      &=(x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2)
            \end{align}$$
            and
            $$\begin{align}
              L_1(x) + L_1(y)&=L_1(x_1, x_2) + L_1(y_1, y_2)\\
                             &=(x_1, x_2)+(y_1,y_2)\\
                             &=(x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2)
            \end{align}$$
            And here we see that `L_1(x+y)=L_1(x)+L_1(y)` and so
            <a href="#prop1">property 1</a> does hold.
          </li>
          <li>
            To check <a href="#prop2">property 2</a> we have to use an arbitrary
            scalar, let's call it `alpha in RR` and an arbitrary vector from `RR^2`, let's
            call it `x=(x_1, x_2)`.
    
            $$\begin{align}
              L_1(\alpha x) &=L_1(\alpha x_1, \alpha x_2)\\
                            &=(\alpha x_1, \alpha x_2)\\
            \end{align}$$
            and
            $$\begin{align}
              \alpha L_1(x) &=\alpha L_1(x_1, x_2)\\
                            &=\alpha (x_1, x_2)\\
                            &=(\alpha x_1, \alpha x_2)\\
            \end{align}$$
            So we see that <a href="#prop2">property 2</a> is satisfied as 
            `L_1(alpha x) = alpha L_1(x)`.
          <br><br>
          So while the linear transformation we defined doesn't really transform anything
          it certainly is a linear transformation.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Whew, I know I called this example 'very simple' but we did cover quite a
        bit. We saw our first linear transformation and proved that it was in fact
        a linear transformation.
        
        This kind of mapping is called the <strong>identity transformation of `RR^2.`</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br><br>
    Now let's try to actually <em>transform</em> a given vector to something that
    isn't the exact same thing using linear transformations.
    </p>
    <h2>matrix representation</h2>
    <p>
    You, like me might be wondering how we can represent linear transformations.
