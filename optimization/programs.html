      <h1>optimization: <em>programs</em></h1>
    </header>
    <h2>introduction</h2>
    Alright, like me, you probably heard about these math program things that
    aren't really related to computers. So it turns out mathematical programming
    is actually just a synonym for mathematical optimization. So no computer code
    here.
    <br><br>
    Okay so mathematical optimization. This is what actually caught my attention.
    The whole premise here is that we have a function of some parameters that we
    want to maximize or minimize. Like dollars $$$!
    <br><br>
    For instance let's think about making a grocery shop run. We ran out of apples,
    bananas and clementines.
