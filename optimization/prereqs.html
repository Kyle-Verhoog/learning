    <h3>matrix multiplication</h3>
    <p>
    There will be a lot of matrix multiplication, so it's important that we
    understand what it is and does.
    
    <br><br>
    
    For me it was never clear in my head how matrix multiplication works or why it's
    defined the way it is. I sort of just memorized how it works with a physical
    mnemonic where I turn my head to the right and then a downwards nod and that's
    it.
    
    A good way to think about matrix multiplication is described <a
    href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/31729">here</a>.
    
    Matrix multiplication is defined the way it is because it is the composition of
    two linear functions, which results in a new linear function.
